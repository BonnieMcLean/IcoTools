<p>We are interested in how well people can guess the meanings of gestures. In this experiment, you will be asked to match the English translation with the corresponding gesture, guessing from between a choice of two gestures. Participation is completely voluntary, anonymous and confidential. There is no known risk involved in this task. However, for any reason if you feel uncomfortable during the task, you can stop at any stage. In this case though, you wonâ€™t be paid the participation fee. 
<p>The study has undergone ethical approval by the University of Hong Kong (Ref no. EA2002040). Please message us on Prolific if you have any questions or concerns.</p>
